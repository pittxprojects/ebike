# DIY EBike Battery System

The main objective of this engineering project was to design a mount that allows a DIY E-bike to receive power from a commercial power tool battery. More specifically, we designed the mount to accept the RYOBI 40-Volt lithium-ion high-capacity battery. The intentions for this scope of design are as follows:


- Employ the economies of scale that are soon to come for lithium-ion batteries
- Take advantage of the safety features already incorporated in the battery
- Provide a battery solution for an E-bike that is easy to source and replace


Included in this repository is:
- A slide deck containing our written documentation on the project
- The Fusion 360 files of our part and the associated components
- The .stl files of our part for 3D printing

Our how-to video can be found [here].
